# Securing CI/CD Pipelines

## **1. Objective**

This document outlines best practices for securing CI/CD pipelines to protect code, secrets, and deployed systems from unauthorized access or vulnerabilities.

---

## **2. General Best Practices**

### **2.1 Use Secure Runners**

- Configure **private runners** to limit access to build resources.
- For shared runners:
  - Restrict their use to non-sensitive projects.
  - Add rules to prevent malicious jobs.

### **2.2 Secure Secret Management**

- Store secrets in protected variables (e.g., GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions).
- Never hard-code secrets directly into code or scripts.

### **2.3 Restrict Permissions**

- Limit access to CI/CD pipelines to authorized team members only.
- Configure protected branches for critical environments (e.g., `main`, `release/*`).

### **2.4 Verify Dependencies**

- Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities before deployment.
- Integrate tools like **Dependabot**, **Snyk**, or **Trivy** into your pipeline.

---

## **3. Secret Management in CI/CD**

### **3.1 Secure Environment Variables**

- Add secrets as protected variables in the CI/CD configuration.
- Example in GitLab CI/CD:
  - Navigate to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**.
  - Add variables with the **Masked** option enabled.

Example script using a secure variable:

```yaml
deploy:
  script:
    - echo "Using API Key: $API_KEY"
```

### **3.2 Secret Rotation**

- Regularly rotate critical keys and passwords used by the pipeline.
- Immediately revoke any compromised secret.

## **4. Validation and Checks**

### **4.1 Static Security Analysis**

- Integrate code scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities before deployment.
- Recommended tools:
  - **SonarQube**: Static code analysis.
  - **Bandit** (Python): Detects common vulnerabilities.

Example of a pipeline step in GitLab:

```yaml
  code_quality:   
    stage: test   
    script:     
      - sonar-scanner
```

### **4.2 Docker Image Scanning**

- Scan Docker images to identify vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like Trivy or Clair.

Example with Trivy in a CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
  scan_image:   
    stage: test   
    script:     
      - trivy image my-image:latest
```

## **5. Securing Deployments**

### **5.1 Deploy to Secure Environments**

- Limit permissions for service accounts used in deployments.
- Configure strict rules for production environments (e.g., read-only access).

### **5.2 Post-Deployment Checks**

- Validate that deployed services are secure after every pipeline.
- Automate security tests for production environments.

---

## **6. Audits and Logging**

### **6.1 Pipeline Logging**

- Record all actions in the CI/CD pipeline for audit purposes.
- Regularly review logs to identify anomalies.

### **6.2 Runner Monitoring**

- Analyze runner metrics to detect suspicious behavior.
- Set alerts for unusually long builds or unexpected jobs.

---

## **7. Recommended Tools**

1. **Dependency Analysis**:
    - **Snyk**: Scans and reports vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - **Dependabot**: Automatically suggests dependency updates.
2. **Docker Image Security**:
    - **Trivy**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.
    - **Clair**: Open-source tool for container scanning.
3. **Pipeline Monitoring**:
    - **Datadog**: Monitors pipelines and runners.
    - **Splunk**: Collects and analyzes pipeline logs.

## **8. Checklist for Secure Pipelines**

- [ ]  Shared runners are restricted or replaced with private runners.
- [ ]  Secrets are stored in secure and masked variables.
- [ ]  Pipelines include a security scanning step (code, dependencies, containers).
- [ ]  Protected branches prevent unauthorized modifications in production.
- [ ]  Pipeline logs are regularly reviewed.
