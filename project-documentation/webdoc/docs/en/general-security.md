# General Security Best Practices

## **1. Objective**

This document aims to provide a set of general best practices to ensure security across all aspects of the project, including code, infrastructure, and development processes.

---

## **2. Essential Best Practices**

### **2.1 Keep Dependencies Updated**

- Regularly monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Use tools such as:
  - **npm audit** (Node.js) or **pip-audit** (Python).
  - Dependency managers like **Dependabot** or **Renovate** to automate updates.

### **2.2 Limit Service Exposure**

- Configure firewalls to restrict access to critical ports.
- Disable unnecessary or non-essential services in production.

### **2.3 Use HTTPS Everywhere**

- Encrypt all communications between services with **SSL/TLS**.
- Renew certificates before expiration (use tools like **Let's Encrypt** for automation).

### **2.4 Secure Logging**

- Never log sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or personal data.
- Protect log files with strict permissions (e.g., read-only access for authorized services).

### **2.5 Strengthen Authentication**

- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for all administrative or critical accounts.
- Use identity managers (e.g., AWS IAM, Keycloak) for precise permission control.

## **3. Best Practices for Code**

1. **Validate User Inputs**:
   - Use libraries like **Joi** or **Yup** to validate data before processing.
   - Reject all data that does not conform to specifications.

2. **Protect Against Common Attacks**:
   - **SQL Injection**: Use ORMs (Object Relational Mappers) like Sequelize or Prisma.
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Sanitize user data in interfaces (e.g., DOMPurify for JavaScript).

3. **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets**:
   - Never store secrets directly in the source code.
   - Use a secure secret manager (refer to `secrets-management.md`).

4. **Secure Dependencies**:
   - Verify the origin of all libraries.
   - Disable unused features in third-party libraries.

## **4. Training and Awareness**

- Organize security awareness sessions for the team.
- Keep the team informed about emerging threats and best practices (via OWASP, for instance).
- Encourage a **"Security by Design"** culture from the start of each project.

## **5. References and Tools**

- **OWASP Top 10**: Guide to the most common vulnerabilities to avoid.
  - Link: [https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- **SSL Labs**: Analyzes server SSL/TLS configurations.
- **Fail2Ban**: Protects against brute force attacks on servers.
- **Clair**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.

## **6. Checklist for a Secure Project**

- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and audited.
- [ ] All critical services use HTTPS.
- [ ] No secrets are present in the source code.
- [ ] Access to services is limited to the minimum necessary.
- [ ] The team is trained on security best practices.
