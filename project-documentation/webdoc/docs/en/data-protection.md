# Sensitive Data Protection

## **1. Objective**

This document outlines best practices to ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive data, such as personal information, passwords, or application-critical data.

---

## **2. General Best Practices**

### **2.1 Minimize Data Collection**

- Collect only the data necessary for the service to function.
- Avoid storing sensitive data unless absolutely essential.

### **2.2 Data Encryption**

- **Data in transit**:
  - Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to protect data exchanged between clients and servers.
- **Data at rest**:
  - Encrypt databases and sensitive files with robust algorithms (e.g., AES-256).

### **2.3 Access Control**

- Restrict access to sensitive data to authorized users and services only.
- Implement logging systems to track who accesses the data.

### **2.4 Anonymization and Pseudonymization**

- **Anonymization**: Remove or mask identifiers from data to make it untraceable.
- **Pseudonymization**: Replace direct identifiers with aliases to limit exposure.

---

## **3. Storage and Backups**

### **3.1 Secure Storage**

- Use secure databases with built-in encryption features (e.g., PostgreSQL with `pgcrypto`).
- Store sensitive files in secure systems (e.g., AWS S3 with encryption enabled).

### **3.2 Backups**

- Encrypt backups before storing them.
- Regularly test backup restoration to ensure integrity.
- Store backups in an isolated environment (e.g., offline storage or secure cloud).

---

## **4. Password Management**

### **4.1 Password Hashing**

- Never store passwords in plain text.
- Use secure hashing algorithms such as **bcrypt**, **Argon2**, or **PBKDF2**.

Example in Node.js with bcrypt:

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash('user_password', 10);
```

### **4.2 Password Policies**

- Enforce strong passwords (at least 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
- Implement periodic password renewal policies.

---

## **5. Monitoring and Logging**

### **5.1 Access Monitoring**

- Log all attempts to access sensitive data.
- Analyze logs to identify abnormal behaviors.

### **5.2 Data Masking in Logs**

- Mask or remove sensitive information before writing it to logs.

Example in Node.js:

```javascript
console.log(`User connected from ${request.ip}`);
```

## **6. Compliance and Regulations**

### **6.1 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**

- Obtain explicit user consent before collecting their data.
- Provide users the ability to view, modify, or delete their personal data.

### **6.2 HIPAA (Health, USA)**

- Encrypt all medical data in compliance with HIPAA standards.
- Restrict access to health information to authorized professionals only.

### **6.3 ISO 27001**

- Implement policies and procedures compliant with ISO standards to ensure information security.

## **7. Checklist for Sensitive Data Protection**

- [ ]  All data in transit is secured via HTTPS.
- [ ]  Sensitive databases are encrypted with AES-256 or equivalent.
- [ ]  Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms.
- [ ]  Backups are encrypted and tested regularly.
- [ ]  Personal data is anonymized or pseudonymized when necessary.
- [ ]  Compliance with GDPR or other applicable regulations is ensured.

## **8. Recommended Tools**

1. **Encryption**:
    - OpenSSL: Generate and manage SSL/TLS certificates.
    - HashiCorp Vault: Centralized secret and certificate management.
2. **Secure Backups**:
    - BorgBackup: Encrypted and deduplicated backups.
    - AWS Backup: Comprehensive solution for cloud backups.
3. **Audit and Monitoring**:
    - Splunk: Log analysis and anomaly detection.
    - Datadog: Access monitoring and real-time alerts.
